GUR(GNU Usage Recorder)
===========

This started as just a simple file to log current memory usage, but from there it has grown(Currently at a stable v1.6 and v2.0-beta.5). 
I origally defined it by calling it "a bash script to take note of current usage"
This description is still pretty accurate. It creates a directory (~/usage) and it creates a date folder every time you log usage and in there it keeps the actual data in a file based on the time. view other features below.

| Option | Description                 |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| -h     | Show help/info              |
| -u     | Log usage               |
| -t      | Log usage on time delay  |
| -k     | Kill current time delay   |
| -c    | Clear all usage logs   |
## Installation
to Install gur all you need to do is move the `gur` file to somewhere in your `$PATH`.
