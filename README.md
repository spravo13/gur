usage-stats
===========

This started as just a simple file to log current memory usage, but from there it has grown. 
I origally defined it by calling it "a bash script to take note of current usage"
This description is still pretty accurate. It creates a directory (~/usage) and it creates a date folder every time you log usage and in there it keeps the actual data in a file based on the time.

## Installation
to Install usage all you need to do is move the `usage` file to somewhere in your `$PATH`.


Unless you want to type `usage` every time you want to write your usage stats, add
this command to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

	alias u='usage'

Now instead of typing `usage` you just need to type `u`.
